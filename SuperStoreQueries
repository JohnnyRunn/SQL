In this SQL project, I am displaying and analyzing inventory, price, and review data for a store

This code shows all items in the store in ascending order (by item id)
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY item_id asc;

In this section we can see all items priced over $100 in ascending order
SELECT *
FROM superstore
WHERE price > 100
ORDER BY price asc;

This code displays all items in stock, filtering out anything that is out of stock
SELECT *
FROM superstore
WHERE stock_quantity >= 1
ORDER BY stock_quantity asc;

Here we can see the total number of items in the store
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore;

Next we see the value of all items combined
SELECT SUM(price * stock_quantity)
FROM superstore;

The average price for electronic items
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Electronics';

The total number of items in stock in the Kitchen Supplies category
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity)
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies';

SELECT *
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating > 4.0
ORDER BY average_rating asc;
